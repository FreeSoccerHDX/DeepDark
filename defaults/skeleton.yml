# if true: name is always visible in your view-range (if not invisible)
Custom-Name-Visible: false
# if true: name is hidden and mob too (only armor/items are displayed)
Invisible: false
#Range[1-infinity] a high spawn-weight will result in more spawn-trys (if zombies have a spawn-weight of 500, and no other mobs exist, there will be 2 times more trys to spawn skeletons)
Spawn-Weight: 1000
#Range[1-100] each time skeletons should spawn: a random number between min-spawns and max-spawns will try to spawn (but less if terrain is bad...)
Min-Spawns: 1
